Important tip for inserting the InventDimId:
--------------------------------------------
You must fill all the dimansions(site,warehouse,location,...) based on the storage dimension group, otherwise it will update the
new inventdimid generated (by findOrcreate) based on the config of the storage dimension.
Actually, for creating a new inventdimid, you must fill all dimension related.
