Dynamics 365 Commerce processes prepayment transactions for the following payment types that are used in Accounts receivable or Commerce:

Customer account deposit payment – A customer pays a deposit at the point of sale (POS). Commerce processes the deposit payment as a prepayment transaction. When you post the transaction, a payment journal is created and posted on the Journal voucher page in Commerce headquarters. The Prepayment journal voucher checkbox on the Payment tab is automatically selected for the payment journal. For more information, including prepayment and tax-specific information that's relevant to the target region, see Globalization resources - Country/region specific help content.
Customer order that has a deposit – A customer creates a customer order at the POS. The customer can pay a deposit for the order, based on the default deposit percentage that's configured on the Customer orders page in Commerce headquarters (Commerce parameters > Customer orders). Commerce processes the deposit payment for the customer order as a prepayment transaction. When you post the transaction, a payment journal is created and posted on the Journal voucher page. The Prepayment journal voucher checkbox on the Payment tab is automatically selected for the payment journal. The payment is settled, and the customer invoice is automatically issued when the order is picked up or delivered.
Call center sales order - A call center customer service representative creates a sales order on behalf of a customer, and the prepayment attribute is set to Yes during the payment capture.
