Commerce Scale Unit (CSU) VS old MPOS:
----------------------------------------
POS cannot talk to Dynamics 365 F&O directly. 
Commerce Scale Unit (CSU) combines the Commerce channel database, Commerce async client, Retail Server, and Cloud point of sale (POS) components. 

CSU Core is the next-generation, high-performance platform that Dynamics 365 Commerce offers to host the headless commerce engine. 
CSU Core provides the same functionality as the existing CSU, but it's highly optimized and performant because it uses ASP.NET Core and .NET Core.

Dynamics 365 Commerce has introduced Store Commerce, Commerce SDK and CSU Core.
CSU Core is a technology update over the legacy CSU. 
Both platforms are used by Dynamics 365 Commerce to host the headless commerce engine, which provides the same functionality. 
However, CSU Core is more efficient and performant because it uses ASP.NET Core and .NET Core, which are cross-platform and high-performance frameworks. 
In CSU Core, the Cloud CSU is hosted in .NET 6, which is the latest version of .NET Core.
