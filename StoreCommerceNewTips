 Dynamics 365 Commerce has introduced Store Commerce, Commerce SDK and CSU Core, which are transforming the way the platform can be used. These new features and improvements will benefit you as a customer and partner, so you should stay updated and informed. CSU Core is a very important and relevant topic that deserves a dedicated article.

CSU Core is a technology update over the legacy CSU. Both platforms are used by Dynamics 365 Commerce to host the headless commerce engine, which provides the same functionality. However, CSU Core is more efficient and performant because it uses ASP.NET Core and .NET Core, which are cross-platform and high-performance frameworks. In CSU Core, the Cloud CSU is hosted in .NET 6, which is the latest version of .NET Core. .NET 6 offers many improvements in performance, scalability, and reliability, such as faster web applications, smarter code optimization, better support for modern web standards, and lower memory usage.
