To expose internal objects and methods to another model use a text editor and edit the model descriptor file, 
add the models that should have access to the internals by adding them to the <InternalsVisibleTo> tag. 

For see for example example K:\AosService\PackagesLocalDirectory\ApplicationSuite\Descriptor\Foundation.xml . 
After adding, if you have still an error, build the ApplicationSuite once.

Another tips:
Common issue with internals occur when they are used in forms and table objects which are public objects. 
The compiler will throw errors if variable of an internal type is added as public as it a more open access modifier than internal. 
The simple way to fix the issue is to change the variable to private.
