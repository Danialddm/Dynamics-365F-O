Open form via its AOT name in D365 Finance & operations
By Maria Jones S - May 27, 2021
 For developers, it can come handy if they can directly open the form via its AOT name in D365 finance & operations rather than opening via its menu item. To do so, you can simply search in the search bar by typing form:<form AOT name>

For example, users management form AOT name is PurchTable. When it is searched, all its references in ERP will be provided as search suggestion.
