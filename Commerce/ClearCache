 

When changing some setup in HQ and pushing the changes down to the stores, something this change is not visible immediately.

This is because that value is cached either on the POS side, or even on the CSU.

 

For mPOS, we can refresh the cache by following the steps I’ve shared with you earlier today:

Close the shift
Close the app
Closs the dllhost.exe under task manager.
 

This should clear any cached values on the POS side.

For CSU (retail server), unfortunately, we don’t have such a way for clearing the cache, and we can only wait, or, for urgent cases, you can restart the CSU from LCS, but that implies a bit of downtime for the stores and users.
