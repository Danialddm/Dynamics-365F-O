If you have an issue after openning the comm about the "unable to load the axtension check manifest.json and ..."
first of all check the manifest file.
Check the API trigger and check the name in it and manifest file.
if they were ok, reinstall and install the POS installer onece (bt powerShell).-->powershell delete the registry files whereas the install does not.
