Good morning Danial,

 

Thank you for your time in our meeting this morning.

 

After restoring a DB from a Sandbox to a Onebox environment, RetailServer needs to be retargeted to have configuration values pointing to the target environment (Your DEV box).

 

Go to LCS Shared asset library -- Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services

And apply the Environment Reprovisioning Tool to your DEV box, as it’s shown below in the screen.

 

 

Note: If you’d come across any issues with this old environment my suggestion is to deploy a fresh DEV box on the same version as PROD (10.0.34) and continue from there (Move DB, Retarget environment).
