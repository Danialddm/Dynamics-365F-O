Commerce runtime (CRT) services
-------------------------------
Commerce runtime (CRT) is a collection of portable .NET libraries that contain the core business logic for the commerce channel and pricing functionality. 
To add or modify any business logic, you should customize CRT. 
Store Commerce calls CRT to request that it performs business logic. 
CRT processes the request and then sends the response back to point of sale. 
POS is like a thin client, all the business logic should be done in CRT.
A CRT service is a group of requests/responses. 
Anytime that you do something in POS, POS sends a request to Commerce Scale Unit, and Commerce Scale Unit calls CRT. 
CRT processes the request and sends back the response.

CRT services
---------------
Each CRT service contains one or more requests/responses. 
For example, the Customer service in CRT contains all the customer-related requests/responses. 
Each request/response is run in a different flow.

@@@@@@this is veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy important@@@@@@@@@@@
CRT extension code should not refer to or use any of the CRT business logic classes, methods, 
or handlers (such as classes from Runtime.Workflow, Runtime.Services, or Runtime.DataServices). 
Because these classes aren't backward compatible, extensions could be broken during an upgrade. 
Extensions should use only request, response, and entity classes from Runtime.*.Messages, Runtime.Framework, Runtime.Data, and Runtime.Entities.
