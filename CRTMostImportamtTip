@@@@@@this is veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy important@@@@@@@@@@@
CRT extension code should not refer to or use any of the CRT business logic classes, methods, 
or handlers (such as classes from Runtime.Workflow, Runtime.Services, or Runtime.DataServices). 
Because these classes aren't backward compatible, extensions could be broken during an upgrade. 
Extensions should use only request, response, and entity classes from Runtime.*.Messages, Runtime.Framework, Runtime.Data, and Runtime.Entities.
