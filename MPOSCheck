If the DB backup came from a different tenant then try these steps:

On DevBox environment, open a PowerShell window – without elevated rights – 
change directory and enter the following commands to run Retail Tenant Update tool (Do not use the link on the Desktop this time), 
with the tenant user you’re activating POS with.

PS K:\temp> cd \RetailSDK\Tools\

PS K:\RetailSDK\Tools> .\RetailTenantUpdateTool.ps1
(for error in connection for the real time service, you should the above powershell command-
A connection to headquarters could not be established. This may due to Retail Real-time Service is not running properly...)
