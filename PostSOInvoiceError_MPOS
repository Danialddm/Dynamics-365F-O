To invoice so from mpos, it may have the following error:

-- Dimension '...(customer,location,department)' is different document marked for settelment.
-- there was a sale/purchase book control vilolation.

You should search the above error texts in the labels to find the proper class.

As a workaround, you should log-in to the mpos with worker of the current legal entity who is employment of that legal entity.
